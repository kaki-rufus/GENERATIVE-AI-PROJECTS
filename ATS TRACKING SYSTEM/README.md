# -ATS-Tracking-System
The ATS Tracking System project is a web-based application designed to streamline the recruitment process by evaluating resumes against job descriptions using artificial intelligence (AI). The system allows users to upload their resumes in PDF format, and the application analyzes the content, compares it with the provided job description, and provides a detailed evaluation. It highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the applicantâ€™s profile, offering insights into how well the resume matches the job requirements. Additionally, the system can provide a percentage match between the resume and the job description, helping job seekers optimize their resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and increase their chances of being shortlisted. This tool leverages Google's generative AI model, Gemini, to provide accurate and actionable feedback for improving resumes.
