# CHAT-WITH-PDF-USING-GEMINI
The ChatWithPDF RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application is a web-based tool that allows users to interact with PDF documents by asking questions and receiving detailed answers based on the content within the PDFs. Users upload PDF files, and the application extracts the text from the documents, splits it into manageable chunks, and stores it in a FAISS vector store. When users input questions related to the document, the system performs a similarity search to retrieve relevant sections and uses Googleâ€™s Gemini model to generate accurate, context-based responses. This tool provides a conversational interface for users to quickly find specific information within large PDF documents, making it ideal for research, legal, and academic purposes. It combines natural language processing and retrieval techniques to offer a powerful and efficient question-answering experience.
