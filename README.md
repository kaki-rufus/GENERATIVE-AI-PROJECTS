## Generative AI Project with Streamlit Deployment

Welcome to my Generative AI project! This application showcases the power of modern large language models (LLMs) and how they can be harnessed using Python. It includes a user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**, allowing real-time interaction with AI-generated content.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how **Generative AI** can be used to create human-like responses based on user input. It leverages pre-trained language models (LLMs) such as `GEMINI`, `LLAMA`, or other Hugging Face models to:

-  Generate creative text and summaries  
- Provide AI-powered Q&A  
- Offer chatbot-style interaction  
- Enable fine-tuned prompt engineering

All this is wrapped in a simple yet elegant **Streamlit app**, making it easily accessible via a web browser.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** â€“ Core programming language  
- **Large Language Models i.e Gemini, Hugging Face Transformers, LLama** â€“ Model inference  
- **Streamlit** â€“ Frontend for deployment
